/**
 * Defines Data Structures to access I2C bus exported by kernel i2c
 * driver.
 *
 * Linux kernel i2c drivers exports
 * - sysfs i2c bus interface
 * to query i2c controller name, to bind i2c slaves attached to i2c bus etc.
 * - devfs i2c bus interface
 * to allow slaves read slave registers by sending ioctl to /dev/i2c-<bus>
 *
 * sdi_sys_i2c creates i2c bus handle that
 * - encapsulates sdi_i2c_bus_t to identify i2c bus and i2c bus operations
 * - i2c bus devfs and sysyfs name
 * - lock object to syncrhonize access to i2c bus
 * - capabilities exported by i2c bus etc.
 *
 * For details on accessing kernel i2c bus from user-space, please refer to
 * Linux kernel documentation Documentation/i2c/dev-interface
