 * @defgroup sdi_internal_sf_io_bus_data_types SDI Internal SmartFusion IO Bus Data Type
 * @brief  SDI SmartFusion IO Bus Data Structure and Bus Operator functions
 * Smart Fusion FPGA is used as a Platform Controller in Dell's Z9100, S6100,
 * S4200 products. Smart Fusion is connected to Platform Devices(FANs, PSUs) and
 * Sensors(Temperature Sensors). Smart Fusion contains an ARM core that's
 * programmed to control these Platform Devices and gather sensor information,
 * thus offloading (partially) the Main CPU from directly interfacing with the
 * platform devices and sensors. Yet, main CPU needs to access SmatFusion FPGA
 * to control platform devices and gather sensor data.
 * In few cases where Smart Fusion can't read a particular temperature sensor
 * (because it resides inside a different chip, ex: NPU, TCAM), CPU needs to gather
 * the temperature sensor value and update the Smart Fusion so the SmartFusion
 * can do Advanced Fan control.
 * Smart Fusion is accessible from main CPU via LPC bus. Smart Fusion provides
 * mailbox mechanism for accessing platform components and its data. This same
 * design is expected to be re-used in future platforms as the same code could
 * be re-used with zero/minimal configuration changes.
 * Smart Fusion's Mail Box exposes 4 Registers via LPC bus.
 *        Mailbox RAM Address High Byte Register (RAM_ADDR_H),
 *        Mailbox RAM Address Low Byte Register (RAM_ADDR_L),
 *        Mailbox RAM Read Data Register (RAM_R_DATA),
 *        Mailbox RAM Write Data Register (RAM_W_DATA).
 * Platform devices/sensors that are controlled and monitored by SmartFusion are
 * mapped at offsets as specified in the Platform specification.
 * In order to read sensor data from CPU, below sequence needs to be followed:
 *        Write offset (high byte) to RAM_ADDR_H,
 *        Write offset (low byte) to RAM_ADDR_L,
 *        Read sensor data by reading value at RAM_R_DATA
 * In order to control platform sensor from CPU, below sequence needs to be followed:
 *        Write offset(high byte) to RAM_ADDR_H,
 *        Write offset(low byte) to RAM_ADDR_L,
 *        Write data to RAM_W_DATA.
 * Smart Fusion Design Doc provides details on offsets at which platform devices
 * are mapped.
 * Smart Fusion MailBox is represented as SDI BUS (sf_io_bus in below xml)
 * and the platform devices that are managed/monitored by Smart Fusion are
 * modelled as SDI DEVICES (ex: sf_temp_sensor in below xml)
 * Smart Fusion io bus driver will register as SDI_BUS and expose read byte and
 * write byte apis @ref sdi_sf_io_bus_framework_apis. Read/Write api's acquire
 * bus lock before Read/Write sequence and release bus lock after Read/Write
 * sequence. Devices attached under SmartFusion will use the Smart Fusion Bus
 * exposed read/write APIs to read/write sensors.
