/**

 * @brief  Driver  API for use within the SDI framework.
 *
 * @defgroup sdi_internal_driver_api SDI Internal Driver API
 * @brief API to manage drivers
 *
 * @ingroup sdi_internal
 * A driver is associated with each chip/board.  A driver can either be a
 * single function device, or it could also be composed of multiple
 * chips/functionality.
 * Irrespcitve of how the device is constructured, a driver in SDI framework
 * provides the following
 * - A method to initialize the device(and implicitly andy subcomponents)
 * - method to adapt how device has to be configured. Example, a pin may be
 *   configured as a GPIO or LED, and device has to be told what mode it should be in.
 * - Registers/advertises the differnet type of resources it has  to the SDI framwork.
